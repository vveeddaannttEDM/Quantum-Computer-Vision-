The integration of Q-FW (Quantum Frank-Wolfe) and QuantumSync creates a hybrid classical-quantum framework for solving constrained quadratic binary optimization (QBO) problems, particularly permutation synchronization. Below is the unified theoretical explanation:
An affine transformation is a function between affine spaces that preserves collinearity
